	  This driver supports NXP ENETC gigabit ethernet controller PCIe
	  physical function (PF) devices, managing ENETC Ports at a privileged
	  level.

	  If compiled as module (M), the module name is fsl-enetc.

	  This driver supports NXP ENETC gigabit ethernet controller PCIe
	  virtual function (VF) devices enabled by the ENETC PF driver.

	  If compiled as module (M), the module name is fsl-enetc-vf.

	---help---
	  This driver adds support for using the ENETC 1588 timer
	  as a PTP clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP
	  programs are getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet
	  packets using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called fsl-enetc-ptp.

	---help---
	  Enable hardware timestamping support on the Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API. Because the RX BD ring dynamic
	  allocation hasn't been supported and it's too expensive to use
	  extended RX BDs if timestamping isn't used, the option was used
	  to control hardware timestamping/extended RX BDs to be enabled
	  or not.
