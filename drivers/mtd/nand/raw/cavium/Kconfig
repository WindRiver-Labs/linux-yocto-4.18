          Enables support for NAND Flash found some Cavium Octeon TX SOCs.
	  Only one of the possible 8 NAND chips is currently supported.
	  Either software ECC or the hardware BCH engine may be used.

	  Support for Cavium BCH block found in octeon-tx series of
	  processors.
	  Currently used for hardware assist to MTD_NAND_CAVIUM,
	  potentially also usable as a general dma_engine.
