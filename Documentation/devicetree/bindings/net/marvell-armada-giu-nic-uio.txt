* Marvell Armada GIU NIC UIO

This entry is used by the generic platform uio driver (uio_pdrv_genirq) for:
1) mapping the gnic configuration registers to user-space.
2) mapping the msi registers to user-space.

required properties:
=========================
- compatible: should be "marvell,armada-giu-nic-uio"
- reg: addresses and length of the register set for the device (must be at the same range as configured for
  "marvell,armada-giu-nic" entry).
  This is a set of two registers used by the management application to pass the base address of the configuration memory
  space.
  it also contains the msi registers space (which is used by the user-space to generate interrupts to host side).
- reg-names: the namespace for each one of the mappings, specified in 'reg' property.

Example:

uio_agnic_0 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-giu-nic-uio";
	reg = <0x6F0000 0x1000
	       0x280000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "agnic_regs", "msi_regs";
	dma-coherent;
	status = "okay";
};
